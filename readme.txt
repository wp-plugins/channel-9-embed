Adds the ability to embed videos from http://channel9.msdn.com to the Embed services

== Description ==

Channel 9 is a video service run by Microsoft. Channel 9 provides a way to embed videos
but is not yet on the WordPress embeds core list. This plugin allows you to simply paste
a URL to a Channel 9 video as you would with any other embed service into your post. 
The video from Channel 9 will show at that location.

Channel 9 can be found at http://channel9.msdn.com

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

e.g.

1. Upload the plugin to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Place the URL to any Channel 9 video in your posts

== FAQ ==

= Can I change the view size of the video? =
Not with this first release. To get the plugin out the door quickly I used the 
default size Channel 9 provides for embeds.

= Help! It is not working! =
Sorry, I have noticed that sometimes embeds can by finicky. Leave a message in the
support forum with the URL you were attempting to use and any other information that
may be relevant.
